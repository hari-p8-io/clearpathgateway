### Technology Foundation
- **Platform**: Java 21 with Virtual Threads for ultra-low latency
- **Database**: Cloud Spanner for ACID transactions and global consistency
- **Caching**: Redis for sub-millisecond balance lookups
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption with HSM key management
- **API**: OpenAPI 3.0 REST APIs with real-time monitoring

## Data Architecture & Financial Controls

### Balance Management Strategy
| Component | Technology | Purpose | Performance |
|-----------|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Live Balances** | Cloud Spanner | ACID transaction processing | < 50ms writes |
| **Balance Cache** | Redis | Hot balance data | < 1ms reads |
| **Audit Trail** | Cloud Spanner | Regulatory compliance | 7-year retention |
| **Backup Storage** | S3 | Disaster recovery | Cross-region replication |

### Financial Control Framework
- **Net Debit Cap Enforcement**: Real-time monitoring against MAS limits
- **Transaction Limits**: Configurable per-participant transaction limits
- **Risk Thresholds**: Automated alerts for unusual activity patterns
- **Reconciliation**: End-of-day balance reconciliation and reporting

## Risk Management & Compliance

### Financial Risk Controls
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous balance and limit tracking
- **Automated Alerts**: Immediate notification of limit breaches
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic protection against system failures
- **Fallback Procedures**: Manual override capabilities for critical situations

### Regulatory Compliance
- **MAS Reporting**: Automated regulatory report generation
- **Audit Requirements**: Complete transaction audit trail (7-year retention)
- **Data Sovereignty**: Singapore-only data storage and processing
- **Security Standards**: Bank-grade security with encryption at rest and in transit

## API Design & Integration

### Core API Endpoints
| Endpoint | Purpose | SLA | Usage |
|----------|---------|-----|--------|
| `POST /liquidity/balance/check` | Verify available balance | < 200ms | Pre-authorization |
| `POST /liquidity/balance/update` | Update participant balance | < 100ms | Transaction settlement |
| `GET /liquidity/balance/{participantId}` | Get current balance | < 50ms | Status inquiry |
| `GET /health` | Service health check | < 10ms | Monitoring |

### Integration Pattern
- **Synchronous API**: Direct REST API calls for real-time authorization
- **Event Notification**: Kafka events for balance change notifications
- **Batch Processing**: End-of-day reconciliation and reporting
- **Emergency Procedures**: Manual intervention capabilities

## Deployment & Operations

### High Availability Design
- **Multi-Zone Deployment**: Active-active across Singapore regions
- **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic scaling based on transaction volume
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent routing for optimal performance
- **Disaster Recovery**: < 5-minute RTO with zero data loss

### Monitoring & Alerting
- **Real-time Dashboards**: Live balance and transaction monitoring
- **SLA Tracking**: Continuous monitoring of 200ms authorization SLA
- **Business Metrics**: Authorization rates, balance utilization, limit compliance
- **Operational Alerts**: Immediate notification of issues or breaches

## Success Metrics & KPIs

### Business Success Metrics
| Metric | Target | Business Impact |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **Authorization Time** | < 200ms | Enables 4.5s payment SLA |
