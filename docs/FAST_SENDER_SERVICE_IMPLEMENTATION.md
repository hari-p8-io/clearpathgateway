### Technology Foundation
- **Platform**: Java 21 with Virtual Threads for high-performance transmission
- **XML Processing**: Enterprise-grade JAXB for ISO 20022 compliance
- **HTTP/2**: Advanced protocol support for optimal G3 Host communication
- **Monitoring**: Real-time transmission tracking and performance metrics
- **Resilience**: Multi-tier fallback with guaranteed message preservation

## Message Processing & Delivery

### Transmission Workflow
1. **Message Reception**: Receive processed payments from internal services
2. **Format Transformation**: Convert unified JSON back to ISO 20022 XML
3. **Validation**: Ensure XML compliance and message integrity
4. **Transmission**: Send to G3 Host via CPG with delivery confirmation
5. **Retry Management**: Handle failures with intelligent retry logic
6. **Audit Logging**: Record complete transmission history

### Delivery Guarantee Strategy
- **Three-Tier Retry**: Immediate → Exponential backoff → Manual intervention
- **Fallback Storage**: S3 backup for messages exceeding retry limits
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Idempotency controls to prevent duplicate transmission
- **Real-time Tracking**: Live monitoring of transmission status and performance

### Data Management
| Component | Technology | Purpose | Retention |
|-----------|------------|---------|-----------|
| **Active Transmissions** | Cloud Spanner | Real-time tracking | 1 year |
| **Delivery Status** | Redis | Fast status lookups | 7 days |
| **Failed Messages** | S3 | Manual intervention queue | 3 years |
| **Audit Trail** | Cloud Spanner | Regulatory compliance | 7 years |

## Resilience & Reliability

### Delivery Assurance
- **Guaranteed Delivery**: 100% message delivery through multi-tier retry
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic protection against G3 Host failures
- **Timeout Management**: Intelligent timeout handling with escalation
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of G3 Host connectivity

### Performance Optimization
- **Virtual Threads**: Java 21 virtual threads for optimal concurrency
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized HTTP/2 connections to CPG
- **Caching**: Redis-based caching for configuration and status data
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of high-volume transmission periods
